# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

Here are the questions and the circuit's board screenshots of my works in this chapter

1. Change the amount of time the LED is off to 1 second. (Leaving the amount of time the LED is on at 1‚ÅÑ2 second.)

2. Change the pin to which the LED is connected from pin 13 to pin 2. (Note that both the circuit AND the program must be changed.)

3. Hook up 8 LEDs to pins 2 through 9 (with resistors, of course.) Modify the code to turn on each one in order and then extinguish them in order. HINT: hook them up one additional LED at a time and make sure the new one works before you add the next one.

4. CHALLENGE: Now that you have 8 LEDs working, make them turn on and off in a pattern different from the one in exercise 3.
